==================================================================================

This directory contains a sample submission for the ChaLearn AutoML challenge, Petersburg hackathon.
The time budget is set to 2 minutes per dataset (10 minutes for 5 datasets), the code tries to use half of the time budget.
This is a code submit challenge -- submit code, do not submit predictions.
Please write a short description on the codalab.org platform when submitting.


==================================================================================

Instructions:

- The metadata file must be included and remain unchanged. 
- The directory structure and naming should remain unchanged.

- To create a valid submission, zip all the file with:
		zip -r zipfilename *
starting from this directory, i.e. do not zip the directory itself, just its contents.
The directory may also be zipped by turning on the flag 
zipme = True
in run.py

- For zipfilename use something explicit to remember the nature of its contents (algorithm name, code version, etc.)

- To submit the code, you do not need to generate prediction results on your local machine, just submit the contents of this directory as a zip file.
